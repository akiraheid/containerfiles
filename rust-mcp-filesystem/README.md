Rust MCP Filesystem is a blazingly fast, asynchronous, and lightweight MCP
(Model Context Protocol) server designed for efficient handling of various
filesystem operations. This project is a pure Rust rewrite of the
JavaScript-based @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem, offering enhanced
capabilities, improved performance, and a robust feature set tailored for modern
filesystem interactions.
